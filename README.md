# NBA_Predictions

Project Goal: Understand and predict NBA Game outcomes, and NBA Bets that have positive Expected Value (EV).

Method: Use historical betting data, nba game data, nba player data to create a model that produces a probability prediction that is more well-calibrated than the implicit
  probability associated with 'moneyline' bets and 'spread bets'. Identify the highest +EV bets in real-time via [ESPN game lines data, NBA team/player data] to calculateand profit long-term on placed bets.
